Buggles are a very social and intelligent species. Building nest in large trees that grow on the planet. 
These trees are usually are around a hundred feet tall with large branches and canopies. 
The trees have a dip/area in the middle of the tree that is used as the heart of the nest. 
This is where the Queen is, surrounded by all the bugglets in the nest and most their mothers. 
This acts as a nursery while the various branches act as homes and or places for buggles to socialize and learn. 
Buggles have basic schooling as far as teaching bugglets the basics of how to survive and how to use simple tools 
that buggles have been able to develop over generations (simple things such as vine for rope and 
giant leaves used as baskets).
