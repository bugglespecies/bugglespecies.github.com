The Buggles home planet, currently labeled as Cera, is about 4x bigger than Earth. 
It's the second moon orbiting a gas giant planet that is currently unnamed. 
This unnamed planet is the fifth planet orbiting around a blue star. 
The rotation of the moon relevant to the planet is so slow that it leaves the moon 
in a constant new moon state, meaning that it's always in the shadow of the gas planet. 
However, despite being in a shadow, life still thrives on the moon. 
It's bioluminescent water, flora, and fauna all live in peace in their shadow moon.
