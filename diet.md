The diet of a buggle is fairly simple. They possess an omnivore diet, eating small 
mammals that scatter around the planets floor, insects that live in the trees, and 
their favorite fruits called Tang. This is the fruit that gives buggles their acidic 
saliva and fluids, tang closely resembling an Earth's mango but with the taste somewhat 
resembling the mix of a pear, mango, and peach.
