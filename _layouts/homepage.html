				<h2 class="text-primary">The Buggle Lore</h2>
				<p>Buggles are a feline based alien species with special adaptations they've gained through generations. 
				Buggles were originally made by a small group of  people back in early/mid 2016. The person who deserves 
				most credit for the original idea for Buggles is a girl named Elsie in the United Kingdoms, we sadly have 
				no way of contacting her anymore however. Buggles are now lead by the current Queen Nii Nii who took over 
				lead once everyone from the original group left without a trace.</p>

				<h2 class="text-primary">The Buggle Society</h2>
				<p>To simplify it, Buggles are large bioluminescent felines with a bite worse than their bark. 
				Their fur is primarily black with some parts of it glowing a variety of colors depending on the individual. 
				Areas such as their spotted pelt pattern, eyes, nose, mouth, antenna, and paws glow due to the bioluminescence  
				in their blood. Their blood glows due to the special minerals in the water they drink. The same water that 
				flows throughout the whole planet. Buggles are a fairly large species, an adult female standing around 5ft 
				and a male standing around 6ft, not including antenna height. A Queen Buggle will usually stand a little taller 
				than males at around 6.5-7ft, setting her apart from the others. Meanwhile, a bugglet (baby buggle) will be around 
				1ft tall when it's first able to walk around and about 3ft tall when it's allowed to leave the nest. Wingspan 
				for an adult buggle would average at about 20ft from tip to tip. Average age for a buggle is about 15-25 years, 
				while a Queen can live up to around 50 years long as a rival doesn't try to over throw them. As far as defense, 
				buggles have basic claws and fangs, but they also gained the perk of having acidic bodily fluid due to the continuous 
				consumption of their favorite fruits. The fruits that grow around their nest are mildly/extremely toxic to other 
				species, but buggles have adapted with these fruits and gained their toxicity. This acidic component is present 
				in all bodily fluids and is a great defense when in a fight.</p>
