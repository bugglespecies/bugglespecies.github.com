Buggles are a feline based alien species with special adaptations they've gained through generations. 
Buggles were originally made by a small group of  people back in early/mid 2016. 
The person who deserves most credit for the original idea for Buggles is a girl named Elsie in the United Kingdoms, 
we sadly have no way of contacting her anymore however. 
Buggles are now lead by the current Queen Nii Nii who took over lead once everyone from the original group left without a trace.
