Rest in peace, Freya. You shall be missed. Thank you all for respecting, caring and being mature about this. 
Everyone has been a beautiful person. I'm sure Freya is so pleased with us. She died young. 
Let her rest peacefully and let her never be forgotten. Giza, I wish you a lovely future, never give up, stay the 
wonderful person you are. Again, thank you all for helping Giza through this tough moment. 
Freya will absolutely never be forgotten.
