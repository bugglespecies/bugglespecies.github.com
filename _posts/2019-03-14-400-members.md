We would like to thank everyone for being awesome as things progress and evolve!
When we sat down today we legitimately could not think of a way to thank each and every one of you.
But at least we put something up on the website right? Hopefully? No? Ok.
In all seriousness however. Thank you all so much for 400 registered users. If you would
like to join our ever growing family check us out on our Official Discord server [here](https://buggles.ml/discord).
Thank you all!
