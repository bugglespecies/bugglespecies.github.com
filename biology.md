To simplify it, Buggles are large bioluminescent felines with a bite worse than their bark. 
Their fur is primarily black with some parts of it glowing a variety of colors depending on 
the individual. Areas such as their spotted pelt pattern, eyes, nose, mouth, antenna, and 
paws glow due to the bioluminescence  in their blood. Their blood glows due to the special 
minerals in the water they drink. The same water that flows throughout the whole planet. 
Buggles are a fairly large species, an adult female standing around 5ft and a male standing 
around 6ft, not including antenna height. A Queen Buggle will usually stand a little taller 
than males at around 6.5-7ft, setting her apart from the others. Meanwhile, a bugglet (baby 
buggle) will be around 1ft tall when it's first able to walk around and about 3ft tall when 
it's allowed to leave the nest. Wingspan for an adult buggle would average at about 20ft 
from tip to tip. Average age for a buggle is about 15-25 years, while a Queen can live up to 
around 50 years long as a rival doesn't try to over throw them. As far as defense, buggles 
have basic claws and fangs, but they also gained the perk of having acidic bodily fluid due 
to the continuous consumption of their favorite fruits. The fruits that grow around their 
nest are mildly/extremely toxic to other species, but buggles have adapted with these fruits 
and gained their toxicity. This acidic component is present in all bodily fluids and is a great 
defense when in a fight.
